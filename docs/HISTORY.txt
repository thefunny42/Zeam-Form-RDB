Changes
=======

1.0 (2012/10/11)
----------------

* Refactor not to rely any longer on ``zope.schema`` or
  ``megrok.rdb``. SQLAlchemy Column's are directly converted to zeam
  form fields. This requires ``zeam.form.ztk`` 1.3 or higher.

* Add tests on field generation.


1.0b2 (2012/06/21)
------------------

* Add support for ``title_query`` to filter out terms in a generated
  ForeignKey vocabulary.

1.0b1 (2012/04/27)
------------------

* Initial version.
